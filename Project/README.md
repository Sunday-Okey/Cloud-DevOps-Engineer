# Project: Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

In this project, you’ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. You will write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the ground up. You will begin with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles, and software. The procedure you follow here will become part of your portfolio of cloud projects. You’ll do it exactly as it’s done on the job - following best practices and scripting as much as possible.

## Project Scenario

Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram, and the requirement is to deploy this new application to the AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code.
You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software. Since the underlying network infrastructure will be maintained by a separate team, you must create independent stacks for the network infrastructure and the application itself. Infrastructure spin up and tear down needs to be automated so that each team can create and discard testing environments on demand.
